README
------
The current prototype for the test files generator is composed of the files:

testgen.h
testgen.c

Installation
------------
For now, the generator can be built as follows:

h5cc testgen.c -o testgen

The test generator creates files and datasets with features available by default
in the HDF5 library. To test features not included by default, the user must 
define certain macros. For instance, to test the external filter szip, the user must define the macro HAVE_SZIP.

Execution
---------
To run the generator, just execute it in the command line without any arguments.
After a successful execution, a number of test files will be created in the
execution directory.
