README
------
The current prototype for the test files generator is composed of the files:

testgen.h
testgen.c

Installation
------------
For now, the generator can be built as follows:

h5cc testgen.c -o testgen

Execution
---------
To run the generator, just execute it in the command line without any arguments.
After a successful execution, a number of test files will be created in the
execution directory.
