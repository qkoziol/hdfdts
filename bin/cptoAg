# Check out the svn version, generate all the autoconfigure files, copy to
# the <version>_Ag version and commit them there.
# 
# $1: version name to be copied
# $1_Ag: version with autogen files
#
# Author: Albert Cheng, 2015/10/09

# Algorithm:
# 1. Check out an export version of Original branch. (prevent any commit)
# 2. Run autogen in the Original branch.
# 3. If the Ag-export version is not around (from previous run), check
#    out an export version of the Ag branch.
# 4. diff the Original branch with the Ag-export branch for any differences.
#    If no difference, no conversion is needed. Exit 0
# 5. Check out an commit-able version of the Ag branch.
# 6. Copy the whole Original branch to the Ag branch and commit any changes.
# 7. Check out an export version of the Ag branch.
# 8. Post conversion diff the Original branch with the Ag-export branch for
#    any differences.  Report any difference detected.
# Leave the Ag-export branch around for next conversion run.
