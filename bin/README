Each snapshot-<TestName> directory should have 2 local files (not checked into svn):

snapshot_params - containing 
HDFREPOS=<name of the svn repository> and 
SNAPSHOTNAME=<TestName>

snapshot_version - containing
SWVERSION=<name of the svn repository> and
SWVER="-r1.8" or other version number.  This may be changed to allow branch names 
that are unrelated to numeric versions
