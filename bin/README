Each snapshot-<TestName> directory should have 2 local files (not checked into svn):

snapshot_params - containing 
HDFREPOS=<name of the svn repository> and 
SNAPSHOTNAME=<TestName>
GIT_URL=<url to clone git repository>
GIT_BRANCH=<name of branch to be tested (may be omitted for testing default branches)>

snapshot_version - containing
SWVERSION=<name of the svn repository> and
SWVER="-r1.8" or other version number.  This may be changed to allow branch names 
that are unrelated to numeric versions.
