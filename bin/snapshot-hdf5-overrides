   # directory, and tests will always run even though source code hasn't 
   # changed.  The configure file is source controlled in the hdf5_1_8 
   # branch and should be also in all release branches, but is not source
   # controlled in develop or in support branches hdf5_1_10 and above.
   # The best indicator I've found to determine whether configure should be
   # added to the commit is that if USE_MAINTAINER_MODE=no is found in 
   # configure, configure should be added to the commit.
