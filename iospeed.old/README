IOSPEED is a simple IO Speed benchmark tools, testing the following
IO API's.
    Unix I/O:
	Unix basic I/O using open/close/read/write API
    Posix I/O:
	POSIX IO API using fopen/fclose/fread/fwrite
    FFIO:
	Flexible File I/O API (SGI systems only)
    Unix Direct I/O:
	Unix basic I/O with DIRECT I/O mode (not available on all systems)
    Unix Non-block I/O:
	Unix basic I/O with non-block mode (not available on all systems)
    mmap I/O:
	Mapping the file directly into memory using mmap function.
    Direct I/O with mmap:
	Direct I/O with mmap.

How to build:
    % cp Makefile.in Makefile	# then customize it accordingly.
    % make clean	# clean out previous built binary
    % make		# to build iospeed

How to run:
    % ./iospeed			    # run default setting using Unix I/O.
    % ./iospeed	help		    # display help page.
    % ./iospeed -m 1		    # same as default.
    % ./iospeed -m 3    	    # run Unix Direct IO
    % ./iospeed -m 1 -w -s 1000	    # Run Unix IO write-only for datasize = 1000MB.
    % ./iospeed -m 3 -w -s 1000	    # Run Direct IO for datasize = 1000MB.
    % ./iospeed -m 3 -w -b 4096	    # Run Direct IO with memory buffer of 4KB.
    % ./iospeed -m 6 -w -b 16384    # Run mmap IO with memory buffer of 16KB.
